# Campus Power Tracker

A web app to help students on a university campus with spotty power find out where the juice is flowing. Powered by crowdsourced reports—no fancy sensors, just student smarts.

## What It Does
- Shows a list of campus spots (like Library, Dorm A, Cafeteria) and their power status (On/Off).
- Lets students report whether power’s on or off at a location.
- Built for learning and solving a real problem!

## How to Run It
1. Clone this repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).
3. Click around—report power statuses and watch the list update (it’s all local for now).

## Status
Work in progress! Right now, it’s a basic frontend with fake data. Next up: adding a backend to save reports for real.

## To-Do
- Hook up a server to store reports.
- Make it look prettier.
- Share it with campus friends for testing.
